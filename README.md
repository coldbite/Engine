# Prerequisites
You must installed the D-Language compiler from [dlang.org](https://dlang.org).

For an easy development, we recommend `Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA` with [d-lang Plugin](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage).

The Plugin works currently not on all `Jetbrains` IDE's Versions.

# Installation
### with `Git`
> git clone https://github.com/coldbite/Engine.git

Open the cloned directory with `Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA` ([Version `2024.2`!](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/other.html)) and you can start directly.

### with `D`
> dub add coldbite
